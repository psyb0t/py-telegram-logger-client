![py-telegram-logger-client](assets/py-telegram-logger-client.jpg)

Welcome to the telegram-logger-client - where your logs go to become stars!

## 🛠 Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you've got your backstage pass ready:

1. You'll need to set up and run the telegram-logger service. It's like the bouncer at the club - without it, your logs aren't getting in.

2. Head over to [https://github.com/psyb0t/telegram-logger](https://github.com/psyb0t/telegram-logger) for the VIP instructions on setting up the telegram-logger service.

3. Once you've got that service up and running, come back here and let's make some noise!

## 🎭 Installation (No Secret Handshake Required)

Install this badass as a module and executable:

```shell
pip install telegram-logger-client
```

Go with `pipx` to just use it as an executable:

```shell
pipx install telegram-logger-client
```

## 🕹️ Usage (AKA How to Make Some Noise)

### 🐍 As a Python Module

Summon the TelegramLoggerClient in your Python code:

```python
from telegram_logger_client import TelegramLoggerClient

# Create your logger
logger = TelegramLoggerClient("https://your-logger-url.com", "your-secret-token")

# Send a log (it's like tweeting, but geekier)
logger.send_log(
    caller="CoffeeBot",
    level="warning",
    message="Coffee levels critically low!",
    error="Caffeine deficiency detected",
    request_id="coffee-run-42",
    trace_id="from-bed-to-coffee-machine",
    span_id="mug-to-mouth",
    data={"coffee_type": "Espresso", "sugar": False, "milk": "Oat"}
)
```

### 🔌 Attaching to Existing logging.loggers

Want to supercharge your existing logger with Telegram powers? We've got you covered! Use the `attach_to_logger` function to add Telegram logging to any logger instance:

```python
import logging
from telegram_logger_client import attach_to_logger

# Basic configuration for console output
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Create your logger
logger = logging.getLogger("your_logger_name")

# Set up Telegram logging
attach_to_logger(logger)

# Use the logger as usual
logger.info("This will be sent to Telegram Logger and output to stdout")
```

The `attach_to_logger` function is like a magic wand that adds Telegram logging capabilities to your existing logger. It takes care of all the behind-the-scenes work, so you can focus on what really matters - logging your heart out!

Parameters for `attach_to_logger`:

- `logger`: Your existing logger instance (required)
- `base_url`: The URL where your Telegram Logger service lives (optional if set in environment)
- `x_id`: Your secret Telegram Logger handshake (optional if set in environment)
- `level`: Set a specific logging level for Telegram logging (optional)
- `show_originating_file`: Show the origin of the log (optional)

Don't forget to set your `TELEGRAM_LOGGER_BASE_URL` and `TELEGRAM_LOGGER_X_ID` environment variables, or pass them directly to `attach_to_logger`. Now go forth and log like a boss! 🚀📝

### 🖥️ Command Line Magic

First, set up your secret lair:

```shell
export TELEGRAM_LOGGER_BASE_URL=https://your-logger-url.com
export TELEGRAM_LOGGER_X_ID=your-secret-token
```

Now, shout into the void (or just send a log):

```shell
telegram-logger-client \
    --caller "WeatherBot" \
    --level "info" \
    --message "It's raining cats and dogs!" \
    --error "Umbrella malfunction" \
    --request-id "weather-101" \
    --trace-id "cloud-to-ground" \
    --span-id "drop-to-splash" \
    --data '{"temperature": "chilly", "wind": "breezy"}'
```

Want to see every little detail? Add the `--debug` flag:

```shell
telegram-logger-client \
    --debug \
    --caller "WeatherBot" \
    --level "info" \
    --message "It's raining cats and dogs!"
```

## 🎭 Logging Levels (Choose Your Adventure)

The client itself has two modes:

- Normal Mode (default): "Just the highlights" mode
- Debug Mode: "I can hear a pin drop" mode

Your logs, on the other hand, can be as dramatic as you want:

- "debug": "console.log" level
- "info": "Just FYI" level
- "warning": "Hmm, that's interesting" level
- "error": "Houston, we have a problem" level

## 🧙‍♂️ API Reference (The Boring but Important Bit)

### 🔮 TelegramLoggerClient

#### `__init__(base_url: str, x_id: str)`

Create your logger. Feed it URLs and tokens.

#### `send_log(...)`

Send your log on a grand adventure. Pack its bags with:

- `caller`: Who's making all this noise?
- `level`: How important is this, really?
- `message`: What's the scoop?
- `error`: What went boom?
- `request_id`: A unique ID for this particular escapade
- `trace_id`: For retracing your steps
- `span_id`: A slice of time in the grand timeline
- `data`: Any extra bits and bobs

Returns a `requests.Response` object (a postcard from your log's journey).

## 🗝️ Environment Variables (Your Logger's Secret Code)

- `TELEGRAM_LOGGER_BASE_URL`: Where your logs call home
- `TELEGRAM_LOGGER_X_ID`: Your logger's super-secret identity

## 🎲 Command Line Arguments (For When You're Feeling Bossy)

- `--debug`: Unleash the full power of logging (optional)
- `--base-url`: A new home for your logs
- `--x-id`: A new secret identity

- `--trace-id`: Breadcrumbs in the digital forest

- `--data`: Everything else but the kitchen sink

Remember: Command line arguments are the divas of the coding world - they always steal the show from environment variables.
